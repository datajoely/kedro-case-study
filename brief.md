# Interview Case Study Brief

As part of our interview process, we’d love for you to walk us through a short case study that showcases how you approach product management. This is an opportunity to highlight your **product sense**, **technical insight**, **communication skills**, and **ability to drive outcomes** in a cross-functional team.

## What We’re Evaluating

- **General PM capabilities**: how you identify problems, prioritize, and execute  
- **Product sense**: what you choose to build and why  
- **Technical fluency**: your understanding of engineering, AI, and developer experience  
- **Collaboration skills**: how you work with design, engineering, and stakeholders  
- **Domain experience**: your understanding of developers and AI-powered products  

> **Note:** If you don’t have experience with developer tools or AI applied to software development, that’s okay—focus on showing your aptitude to ramp up in these areas.

## What to Present
Choose a product you’ve actually worked on, and cover:

1. **Context**  
   - Who the users are  
   - What problem you’re solving  
   - Why it matters  

2. **Your Approach**  
   - How you defined the product  
   - How you collaborated across functions  
   - Key decisions made  
   - Your specific contributions  

3. **The Outcome**  
   - What you learned  
   - What worked / what didn’t  
   - What you’d do differently  

4. **If Speculative**  
   - How you’d validate it  
   - What the MVP would look like  
   - How you’d approach go-to-market

## Format

- **Duration**: 15–20 minutes presentation + 10–15 minutes Q&A  
- **Preferred format**: slide deck  
- **Alternatives**: whiteboards, Figma, or demos (get creative!)  
- **Expectation**: not a polished marketing deck—just a thoughtful look into how you think and work.
